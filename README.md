## Installation

1. Ensure [BCC](https://github.com/iovisor/bcc) is installed.
2. Install `alertyx`:
    - Clone this repository and build the binary (requires Go):
        ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/sourque/alertyx
        cd alertyx
        go build
        ```
    - Or download the `alertyx` binary from releases.

## Usage

```txt
Usage:
  alertyx [command]

Available Commands:
  help        Help about any command
  hunt        Hunt for existing malicious activity
  mitigate    Mitigate all known vulnerabilities
  monitor     Actively monitor for malicious action
  version     Print alertyx version

Flags:
  -a, --active    Counter detected malicious activity (dangerous, may clobber)
  -h, --help      Help for alertyx
  -s, --syslog    Output to syslog
  -v, --verbose   Enable verbose output

Use "alertyx [command] --help" for more information about a command.
```

## Information

`alertyx` gathers information from the kernel through eBPF (with BCC). These sources are analyzed with information from categorized techniques and vulnerabilities.

> There is no kernelspace component (other than the eBPF data-gathering code), which means `alertyx` is more susceptible to resource exhaustion and various types of executable manipulation. However, if that happens, you'll probably know about it.

## Fun Future Activities

- **New Sources**:
    - eBPF additions
    - PAM authentication
    - File permission changes (for sensitive dirs like /tmp and creating new bins/suid/sgid)
- **Techs/Threat Actions**:
    - Send lines per <time unit> (bash)
    - Time between shell spawn and sending commands (maybe)
    - Connect() (detect if being scanned)
- **Fixes**:
    - Pwd incorrectly reports absolute path when in mounted/chrooted environment (e.g., tmux)
    - Race condition in BCC code? Imagine one open syscall on the same PID starts before another and ends after -- details would be overwritten?
